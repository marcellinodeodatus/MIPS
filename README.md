# MIPS

Project for CDA3103. Written a program called MySPIM, a core part of a mini processor simulator using C programming language on a Unix platform. MySPIM will demonstrate functions of the MIPS processor as well as the principle actions of the datapath and the control signals of a MIPS processor. The simulator should read in a file containing MIPS machine codes and simulate what the MIPS processor does cycle-by-cycle.
